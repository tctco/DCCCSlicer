3DSlicer plugin for Deep Cascaded Cerebral Calculator (formerly known as Deep Cascaded Centiloid Calculator).

An open-source, super-simple, ultra-fast, fully-automated, fairly-accurate and PET-only solution to conduct spatial normalization and semi-quantification for almost any brain PET modalities.

Abeta, tau, FDG, DAT, MET, synaptic density... you name it!

> Currently DCCCSlicer is only available on Windows. You may need to recompile it from source on other platforms.

PS: You can also quickly align brain images with rigid transformation to the MNI space by localizing AC and PC. This step may be required for spatial normalization with SPM.

**Shiny new features!** DCCCSlicer can interpret input Abeta and tau PET images now! It not only help determine if a patient may have AD, but also identifies the regions of pathological deposition!
